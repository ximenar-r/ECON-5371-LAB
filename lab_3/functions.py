"""
functions.py -- Lab 3 (Structural Breaks)

Three functions this lab: run_chow_test(), run_qlr_test(), and
detect_multiple_breaks(). Unlike the earlier labs, where repeated code
was wrapped in a function and kept INSIDE the lab script, these live
in their own file, functions.py, in the same folder.

Why a separate file, and not just a function inside lab_3.py? All
three are reusable beyond this one script -- you might want this
logic in a later lab, in your own research project, or in a
problem set, without copying code between files. A function inside
lab_3.py is only easy to reuse within lab_3.py; a function in its own
module can be imported anywhere with

    from functions import run_chow_test, run_qlr_test, detect_multiple_breaks

The rule of thumb from Lab 2 still applies (keep vs. inline) -- this
is the next step past it: once a function is reusable across SCRIPTS,
not just within one script, it belongs in its own file.

A note on detect_multiple_breaks(): this is a simplified, from-scratch
version of Bai-Perron multiple-break detection, built using repeated
calls to the same QLR logic as run_qlr_test() rather than a separate
package. See the function's own docstring for why, and for the
significance-level choice it uses.

def detect_multiple_breaks(series, min_size=12, trim=0.15, alpha=0.0005):
    """Detect multiple structural breaks via recursive QLR segmentation.

    This is a simplified, from-scratch version of Bai-Perron multiple-
    break detection: it repeatedly applies the SAME single-break QLR
    logic as run_qlr_test() to successively smaller segments of the
    series, splitting a segment in two whenever QLR finds a
    sufficiently significant break inside it, and stopping when no
    remaining segment has one.

    Why build this instead of using a dedicated package (e.g.
    `ruptures`, which implements the actual Bai-Perron / PELT
    algorithm)? That package requires a compiled C extension, and
    installing it fails on some machines without the
    Microsoft C++ Build Tools (Windows) already installed -- a
    heavyweight dependency for one step of one lab. Binary
    segmentation via repeated QLR is conceptually the same idea
    (search for the single strongest break, then recurse on each
    side) and needs nothing beyond NumPy and SciPy, which every
    other test in this lab already uses.

    A note on `alpha`: naively re-running QLR at the usual 0.05
    significance level on every segment tends to find SPURIOUS extra
    breaks, because we are effectively running many hypothesis tests
    (one per candidate split point, repeated over every segment) and
    some will look "significant" by chance alone. `alpha=0.0005` is a
    rough Bonferroni-style correction: with roughly 100-150 candidate
    split points tested per full-series search (set by `trim`), a
    family-wise error rate of 0.05 implies an per-test alpha near
    0.05/126 ~= 0.0004. We round to 0.0005. This is not a free
    parameter to tune until the answer looks right -- it is a
    deliberately conservative threshold chosen to avoid exactly the
    over-detection problem described above.

    Parameters
    ----------
    series : array-like
        The series to search, as a plain array of values.
    min_size : int, default 12
        Minimum number of observations required on EITHER side of a
        candidate break for it to be accepted. Prevents the
        recursion from splitting off segments too short to estimate
        reliably.
    trim : float, default 0.15
        Passed to the QLR search within each segment -- see
        run_qlr_test().
    alpha : float, default 0.0005
        Significance threshold for accepting a candidate break. See
        the note above.

    Returns
    -------
    list of int
        Sorted list of detected break indices (0-based positions in
