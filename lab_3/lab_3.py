"""
Lab 3: Structural Breaks
=========================

Applies the Chow test, the QLR test, and Bai-Perron multiple-break
detection to a synthetic monthly inflation series with two genuine
regime shifts.

New this lab: the Chow and QLR test functions live in a separate file,
functions.py, in this same folder. See the docstring at the top of
that file for why.

Run this script section by section (recommended: in Positron, run cell
by cell using the '# %%' markers), or top to bottom as a single script.

# Step 1: Install the required packages.
#
#     pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Run this once in a terminal, in this lab's folder -- not as part of
# this script.
#
# Step 2: Set the lab folder location.

# Discussion: Does the mean of this series look constant over time, or
# do you see one or more points where its behavior seems to shift?


# %% 2. Chow Test -- A Known Break Date
#
# Suppose we have a specific reason to suspect a break at a particular
# date -- 2016-01, say. The Chow test asks: does the series' mean
# differ before and after this exact point?
#
# H0: no break -- the mean is the same in both subsamples.

# Discussion: Given the F-statistic and p-value above, do we reject H0?
# What does that tell us -- and what does it NOT tell us, if we hadn't
# already known to look at this specific date?


# %% 3. QLR Test -- An Unknown Break Date
#
# In practice we rarely know the break date in advance. The QLR test
# searches across candidate break points and reports the one that
# produces the largest Chow F-statistic.

# Discussion: Does QLR find the same break date we assumed in Section
# 2 -- without being told where to look? What does it mean that QLR's
# F-statistic at its best point matches the Chow F-statistic from
# Section 2?


# %% 4. Bai-Perron -- Multiple Break Detection
#
# Chow and QLR are both single-break tools: QLR finds the ONE break
# point with the strongest evidence, even if the series has more than
# one regime change. Bai-Perron generalizes this to multiple breaks.
#
# detect_multiple_breaks() (in functions.py) implements a simplified
# version of this idea from scratch: it applies the SAME QLR search
# you just ran in Section 3, first to the whole series, then
# recursively to each half whenever a significant break is found,
# until no remaining segment has one left. See that function's
# docstring for why this lab builds it this way instead of using a
# dedicated package, and for why it uses a stricter-than-usual
# significance threshold.

# standard deviation below, to show what actually changed at each
# break, not just where it happened.

# directly on the plot, rather than just in the printed break dates.

# whether the REGIME's dispersion changed too, not just its level --

# Discussion: How many breaks did Bai-Perron find? Does it agree with
# QLR on at least one of them? Is there a break here that neither Chow
# nor QLR could have told us about -- and why not, given how each test
# is built?
#
# Now look at the segment means and +/- 2 SD bands you just plotted:
# did the break points only shift the LEVEL of inflation, or did the
# spread around that level change too? What would it mean, economically,
# for a regime to be both higher-inflation AND more volatile at the
# same time -- rather than just higher?


# %% 5. Putting It Together -- Which Test, When?
#
# This lab used three different tools on the same series, each
# answering a different version of "is there a break?" Before moving
# on, it's worth being explicit about what each one actually needs
# from you, and what you get back -- because in your own project data,
# nobody hands you the right test. You have to choose.
#
#   Chow test:  You supply a candidate break date. Most powerful of
#               the three WHEN you have a good reason to suspect a
#               specific date (a policy change, a known shock) --
#               it isn't searching for anything, so it isn't paying
#               a statistical price for a search.
#
#   QLR test:   You supply a search window (via `trim`), not a date.
#               Finds the single break the data supports most
#               strongly. The right tool when you suspect ONE break
#               but don't know when -- but it is built to find only
#               one, so it will stay silent about a second break
#               even if one is there.
#
#   Bai-Perron: You supply nothing but the series (plus some tuning
#               knobs: `min_size`, `alpha`). Finds however many
#               breaks the data supports. The right tool when you
#               don't know IF there's one break, several, or none --
#               but that flexibility is exactly why it needs the
#               stricter significance threshold from Section 4: the
#               more places a test is allowed to look, the more
#               places it can find something by chance alone.
#
# None of these is simply "better" than the others -- each buys
# generality (searching over more unknowns) at the cost of a weaker
# test, and that tradeoff is unavoidable, not a defect of any one
# method's implementation.
#
# Discussion: When you apply unit root tests to your own project's,
# you will face the same choice about trend and seasonal specification.
# If you suspect your series has a structural break somewhere in its
# history but you are not sure when, or how many -- which of these three
# tools would you reach for first, and what would make you switch to a different one?
