ECON-5371 — Lab 1: Non-Stationary Models, Seasonality
Week 5

Applies unit root testing (ADF, KPSS), ARIMA identification, SARIMA
estimation, and residual diagnostics to a synthetic quarterly series
with a stochastic trend and seasonal pattern. Forecasting is covered
in Lab 2.

Before running: make sure gdp_synthetic.csv has been downloaded from
Blackboard, placed in your lab_1/ folder, and pushed to your own
GitHub repository. Replace the URL below with YOUR OWN raw GitHub
URL — this one points to the instructor's copy of the data, not
yours.

# %% Environment setup -- run once, in Positron's terminal (not as Python)
#
# This lab is the first time we need a dedicated Python environment for
# this course. An environment is an isolated set of installed packages --
# keeping this course's packages separate from anything else on your
# machine means a package version conflict in one project can't silently
# break another.
#
# The commands below are terminal commands, not Python code -- they will
# not run as part of this script. Open Positron's terminal panel (not the
# Python console) and run them there, once, before running anything else.
#
# 1. Create the environment (only needed the first time):
#
#      conda create -n econ5371 python=3.11
#
# 2. Activate it (needed every time you start a new terminal session):
#
#      conda activate econ5371
#
# 3. Install this lab's required packages into the now-active environment:
#
#      pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# 4. Confirm it worked:
#
#      python -c "import pandas, statsmodels, pmdarima; print('all good')"
#
# From this lab forward, always confirm your terminal shows
# "(econ5371)" at the start of the prompt before running any lab script.
# If you open a new terminal window, you'll need to run step 2 again --
# activation does not persist across terminal sessions.
#
# Also confirm Positron itself is pointed at this same environment for
# running code (not just the terminal): use the interpreter selector,
# usually in the bottom status bar or via the command palette
# ("Python: Select Interpreter"), and choose econ5371 there too.

# (p >= 0.10). Both tests flip and agree -> the level series is I(1).
#
# Note on the KPSS warning: statsmodels may print an InterpolationWarning
# here. That's not an error -- the test statistic falls outside the range
# covered by KPSS's lookup table, so it can only report a bound on the
# p-value (e.g. "p >= 0.10") rather than an exact figure. Given how clearly
# stationary this differenced series is, that's expected, not a problem.

# 10. Residual diagnostics
# =============================================================================
# A well-specified model should leave behind residuals that look like white
# noise -- no leftover pattern, no leftover autocorrelation. If diagnostics
# below fail, that's a sign the model missed something worth revisiting
# before trusting its forecast.
#
# We burn the first 8 residuals (two full seasonal cycles) before testing.
# The state-space filter needs a few observations to initialize; residuals
# from that startup window are not genuine one-step-ahead forecast errors
# and will swamp any diagnostic test if left in. This is the same
# burn-in principle used elsewhere in this course for presample outliers.
